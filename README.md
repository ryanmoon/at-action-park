- Repository of autodmg templates to use with Jenkins.

## Explanation
- So I'm trying to make a resource for using Jenkins, AutoDMG, vFuse, and a couple of other things to make both restorable OS images for use with something like imagr, and bootable vagrant boxes for use with test-kitchen.
- These are my efforts.
- The repo is named after a Shellac album.
